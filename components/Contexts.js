            The overarching LEE Mission allows us to contextually adjust the
            horizons of our interactions and interventions, whilst building
            towards a coherent field of influence and change. A single theory of
            change feels wildly inadequate; instead we are holding open
            questions in a continuous process of landscape scanning and action:

              A right wing context may provide more fertile ground for rapidly
              mobilising complex technologies than a liberal context. Or perhaps
              in a context like Ukraine where crisis and instability has become
              an everyday reality, the motivation for citizens to drive
              alternative governance models is heightened. This could start from
              a desire to support the military via voluntary crowdfunding and
              extend to new sectors and patterns of behaviour.

              In some cases we may need to look to edge communities for an idea
              to gain traction (e.g. a distributed currency), whereas in others
              a supportive social infrastructure is needed to establish agency
              (e.g. a material registry). Each country has something to teach
              us; from land laws in Scotland to open data systems in Taiwan, we
              are open to how our work can weave and adapt to local contexts.

              Recognising that a speculative policy in one context might already
              be triage response in another can increase our collective learning
              and ability to test edge ideas. This could mean working with
              Indigenous communities on Turtle Island (North America) to
              urgently finance the regeneration of indigenous lands. It could
              also entail supporting marginalised communities in England to seed
              alternative housing models in response to the systemic crisis
              crisis.

              On the surface a central bank and an ecological activist may have
              little in common. Yet, central banks have a mandate to preserve
              stability, which in the future could involve recoupling money
              issuance to ecological rights? This logic might also extend to
              cultural intersectional points, such as indigenous perspectives
              and state mandates in locations such as Australia and India.
