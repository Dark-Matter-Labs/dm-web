          Firstly, we want to make you aware of six principles for which all
          personal data must be processed according to Article 5 of the GDPR.
          These principles outline what any company that has a digital presence
          need to keep accountable towards:
        </p>
        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Obey the law, only process
          personal data in a way that people would reasonably expect, and always
          be open about your data protection practices.
        </p>
        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          Purpose limitation: You must normally only process personal data for
          the specific reason you collected it and nothing else.
        </p>
        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          Data minimization: don’t process any more data than you need.
        </p>
        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          Accuracy: Make sure that any personal data you hold is adequate and
          accurate.
        </p>

        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          Storage limitation: Don’t store personal data for longer than you need
          to.
        </p>

        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          Integrity and confidentiality: Always process personal data securely.
        </p>

        <p className="p-xl-regular text-[#EBEBEB]">
          hese principles build the foundation for why data is being collected
          and all of the data that DML is collecting has to fall in line with
          one of these six principles.
